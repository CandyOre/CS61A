# CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

### Description

UC Berkeley CS61A is a course about general programming techniques, primarily using Python 3, switching to Scheme and SQL in the latter of the course.

I'm here to take this course mainly for 2 reasons.

1. Review Python 3 from a new angle, i.e. functional programming.
2. Complete SICP learning, which I gave up in last summer break.

### Resources

I'm using Fall 2020 edition of CS61A. Some details of the materials in different semesters are not the same, but the cores of them are identical.

- [[Fall 2020] Course Website](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/)
- [Online Textbook](http://composingprograms.com/)

Upd: For the third project Ants, I refer to Spring 2022 version for a provided comprehensive GUI, which is not accessible in Fall 2020 version.

Upd: Project Ants in Spring 2022 is much harder than it in Fall 2020 QAQ!

Notice: **DO NOT** look at other's code unless you've finished the problem.

### Progress

I hope to complete this course quickly, namely less than 1 week.
