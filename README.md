# CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

### Description

UC Berkeley CS61A is a course about general programming techniques, primarily using Python 3, switching to Scheme and SQL in the latter of the course. There is a list of what I learned from this course, for your reference.

With Python: 
1. High-Order Function
2. Environment Diagram, a helper to trace name bindings
3. Original Data Abstraction Idea without OOP concept
4. Mutable Values & Functions, Non-local Assignment
5. Polymorphic Functions in Python, e.g. \_\_repr__, \_\_str__
6. Iterator and Build-in Functions for Iteration, e.g. map, filter, zip, etc.

With Scheme:
1. Scheme Lists
2. Generating Code with Quote & Quasiquote
3. Dynamic Scope
4. Tail Calls
5. Macros
6. Structure of Scheme Interpreter, and implement one in project 4.

With SQL:
1. Concept of Declarative Languages
2. Basic Operation, including Table and Aggregation
3. Database Connection with Python and Sqlite.

### Resources

I'm using Fall 2020 edition of CS61A. Some details of the materials in different semesters are not the same, but the cores of them are identical.

- [[Fall 2020] Course Website](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/)
- [[Spring 2022] Course Website](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp22/)
- [Online Textbook](http://composingprograms.com/)

For the 3rd project Ants, I refer to the Spring 2022 version for a provided comprehensive GUI, which is not accessible in the Fall 2020 version. **Upd**: Project Ants in Spring 2022 is much harder than it in Fall 2020 **QAQ**!

For the 4th project, where a scheme interpreter is created, I choose to complete the ~~Challenge Version~~ Normal Version. I'll leave the Challenge Version, which is quite hard to start from scratch in a few days, for the purpose of reviewing.

Other unofficial CS61A repo for reference. **Notice**: DO NOT look at other's code unless you've finished the problem.

### Progress

I'm here to take this course mainly for 2 reasons.

1. Review Python 3 from a new angle, i.e. functional programming.
2. Complete SICP learning, which I gave up in last summer break.

I hope to complete this course quickly, namely less than ~~1 week~~ 10 days.

**Upd**: I basically complete the course by 0731 ww.
