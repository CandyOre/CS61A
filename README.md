# CS61A

### Description

CS61A is a course about general programming techniques, primarily using Python 3, switching to Scheme and SQL in the latter of the course.

I'm here to take this course mainly for 2 reasons.

1. Review Python 3 from a new angle.
2. Complete SICP learning, which I gave up in last summer break.

### Resources

I'm using Fall 2020 edition of CS61A.

- [Course Website](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/)
- [Online Textbook](http://composingprograms.com/)

Other unofficial CS61A repo.

Notice: **DO NOT** look at other's code unless you've finished the problem.

### Progress

I hope to complete this course quickly, namely less than 1 week.
